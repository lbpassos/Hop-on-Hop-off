# Hop-on-Hop-off

The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  develop  a  distributed  mobile  application,  which  aims  to 
provide  tourism  quizzes  on  hop on hop off  buses.  HopOnCMU  will  allow  users  to  answer  quizzes  about 
monuments that they visit on hop on hop off tours and to compete with other users for prizes given out at the 
end of the touring day to those with the most correct answers.
 
Consider the following example of a HopOnCMU usage scenario. A group of users takes a hop on hop off bus in Lisbon and drives to a monume
nt (say the Belem tower). There, users download from the monumentâ€™s WiFi access point the questions related to the monument. As the tourists answer the questions, they 
can share partial results (namely how far all of them have come along and the ranking of the passengers with more  correct  answers). They  continue  to  travel  by  bus  to  several  more  monuments  where  the  process  is repeated at each one. 

At the end of the touring day, the tourist with the most correct answers gets a prize from the tour operator.
